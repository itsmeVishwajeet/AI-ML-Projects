# AI-ML-Projects - This project uses special computer techniques to figure out if tweets are 
positive, negative, or neutral. We will focus on tweets from Twitter and train a smart system 
called LSTM (Deep Learning Algorithm) to understand the emotions in these messages. By 
doing this, we can learn how people feel about different things based on what they write 
online.
